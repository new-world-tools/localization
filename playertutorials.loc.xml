	<string key="tutorial_gathering_fishing1_01_dialogue_body" rel_version="Feature_Player_Tutorials">Fishing allows you to gather unique resources from Aeternum's saltwater coasts, freshwater streams, and everything in between. Each territory has its own subaqueous ecosystem, though species are rarely exclusive to a single territory. While most fish are restricted to one water type, some can thrive in both.
	\n\nBut fish aren't the only catch. &lt;font color="#edc63e"&gt;Flotsam&lt;/font&gt; can be frequently scavenged and although most is trash only fit for salvage, if you're lucky, you'll hoist up a &lt;font color="#edc63e"&gt;Treasure Chest&lt;/font&gt; filled with rare loot. 
	\n\nWhat you catch is purely luck but you can narrow your odds of rarer finds by casting in waters that increase &lt;font color="#edc63e"&gt;Fishing Luck&lt;/font&gt;. Shallow water adds a low bonus, deep water adds more, but by far the biggest bonus comes from active &lt;font color="#edc63e"&gt;Fishing Hotspots&lt;/font&gt;. 
	\n\nActive Broad, Rare, and Secret Hotspots are easily spotted by their leaping fish. Once a Hotspot is depleted, it'll take time before becoming active again.
	\n\n&lt;img src="LyShineUI/Images/Map/Icon/POIs/fish_hotspot1.png" scale="4" yOffset="20" &gt;&lt;/img&gt;Fishing Hotspots you've discovered are marked on your map.
	\n\nYou can raise your &lt;font color="#edc63e"&gt;Fishing Luck&lt;/font&gt; even higher by using higher tier fishing poles, equipping better bait, placing fishing trophies in your house, or by having perks like Lucky Waters on your gear. With high enough fishing luck, you may even chance a glimpse of a Legendary Fish.</string>

	<string key="tutorial_gathering_fishing1_02_dialogue_body" rel_version="Feature_Player_Tutorials">
		While near any body of water, equip your fishing pole using {$player.fishing_activate$}.
	\n\nBefore casting, you may add any &lt;font color="#edc63e"&gt;bait&lt;/font&gt; in your inventory by opening the bait menu with {$ui.toggleFishingBaitWindow$}. Some bait is only effective in either &lt;font color="#edc63e"&gt;Fresh&lt;/font&gt; or &lt;font color="#edc63e"&gt;Salt&lt;/font&gt; water. 
	\n\nCast the line with {$player.fishing_primary$} and hold to increase the distance, then release to cast. Careful distancing is useful for aiming at deeper water or Hotspots.
	
		
	\n\nWhen you have a bite, hook your catch with {$player.fishing_primary$}, then hold to reel in or release to give slack. Be mindful of your line tension: If it becomes too taut, the line will snap and you'll lose the catch (and your bait). If it's too loose, it'll drift away. 
	\n\nFish can have different temperaments which effects how hard they fight and when they get tired. Balance your tension with the ferocity of the fish and wait for the right moment to reel. With enough patience, you can catch anything.

    \n\nAfter the slot is unlocked, Heartrunes can be equipped and swapped out similar to other equipment. Only one Heartrune can be equipped at a time.

    \nOnce a Heartrune is equipped, the Heartrune meter with the same icon as your equipped Heartrune, will be present near your other abilities on the HUD.
    \n\nEngaging in combat will fill the &lt;font color="#edc63e"&gt;meter&lt;/font&gt;, and once it is full, you will be able to activate the equipped Heartrune ability by pressing {$player.rune_ability$}. The meter will need to be filled again after it's used.

    \n\nWhen a Heartrune is first obtained, it will be a minor version of the Heartrune. Heartrunes can be upgraded at the Gypsum Kiln.</string>
