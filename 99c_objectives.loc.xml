Whatever reason the Ancients cultivated them, it was not to defend against the Crimson Madness. \n\nConversely, the mushrooms seem to offer some promise. I was able to infuse them with the azoth from the ruins, and the mushrooms' luminescence dims when in the presence of Corruption. \n\nDesperate as they are, it was not difficult to convince the villagers here to drink the mushroom concoction I prepared, though I did leave out the fact that they were gathered from the ruins. Whether the serum is effective remains to be seen.</string>

Later, their eyes began to glow with a chilling azoth blue, and they eventually became completely non-responsive. The villagers have taken to calling them "Lost," and the condition seems to be irreversible. \n\nI am convinced that with a few more tests, I can eliminate these disappointing side effects, but of course, I am now having great difficulty recruiting more volunteers. Even Brytmar is having doubts.</string>

It seems one of the "Lost" somehow passed their condition on to a family member who had not been a volunteer. I offered to assess and treat the poor woman, but I was met with nothing but anger and fury. \n\nEveryone seems to have forgotten that this effort is in pursuit of protection against a far greater evil! With a few further tests... I am certain I can perfect the cure, and perhaps even find a remedy. If I am to find more volunteers, however, it will not be here. \n\nBrytmar is helping to pack up all my equipment and research, and we will leave this town of fools in the morning.

It will be critical that we strike back against the Corrupted with both a martial and a magical strategy. \n\nTell me - where are you and your allies based? I will meet you there.</string>

This could be a promising partnership.</string>

I'm afraid I have less inspiring tidings for you. \n\nWe've received a dispatch from a warlord among the Corrupted who knows you personally… Captain Thorpe, I believe is the name.</string>
