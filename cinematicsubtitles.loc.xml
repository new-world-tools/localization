	<string key="TempestReckoning03" start="13" end="19" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning04">Abandoned by the power for which she traded everything.</string>

	<string key="TempestReckoning05" start="22" end="29" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning06">Pulling Aeternum, and the world, back from the precipice of doom.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning06" start="29" end="32" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning07">But at what cost?</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning07" start="32" end="38" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning08">So many of their numbers Corrupted or Lost.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning08" start="39" end="45" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning09">Their fragile alliance crumbling as the factions fight for dominance.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning09" start="47" end="53" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning10">And what of the allies they believe they've gained in the Angry Earth?</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning10" start="53" end="56" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning11">It will be clear soon enough...</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning11" start="56" end="62" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning12">That the vengeful hand of nature would grasp far more than equilibrium.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning12" start="64" end="72" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning13">And the void exposed when the surge in Corruption abates will become a threat of itself...</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning13" start="74" end="79" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning14">As the soulless remnants of this conflict rise from the battlefield...</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning14" start="80" end="85" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning15">to find purpose and power in a source as yet unrealized.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning15" start="86" end="97" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning16">Yes, the hapless inhabitants of Aeternum will soon learn that this chapter maye have come to a close...</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning16" start="97" end="105">But the real horrors have just begun.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy01" start="1" end="5" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy02">The gods summoned us from the Old World.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy02" start="5" end="11" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy03">Calling us to paradise, the undying land, they promised life eternal.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy03" start="13" end="20" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy04">The divine Ancients shared their wisdom, directing us to build great temples to house their wonders.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy04" start="21" end="26" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy05">The works of my people shone like a jewel in this New World.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy05" start="27" end="33" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy06">But madness erupted throughout the land, igniting a terrible war.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy06" start="34" end="37" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy07">Our great works were laid to waste.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy07" start="38" end="43" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy08">When the fires cooled, the Ancients had vanished.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy08" start="43" end="50" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy09">Leaving behind only ruins and a doomed race of immortal soldiers guarding empty temples.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy09" start="51" end="54" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy10">But we were determined to endure.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy10" start="56" end="62" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy11">In the absence of the Ancients, we became the masters of our own destiny.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy11" start="63" end="67" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy12">We battled the primordial beings birthed by the cataclysm.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy12" start="67" end="76" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy13">And discovered immortality became a curse. Death had not been banished, only transformed.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy13" start="78" end="81" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy14">Even the madness returned to plague us anew.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy14" start="83" end="92" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy15">In the end, the Ancients' promises had been nothing but lies.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy15" start="94" end="102">I pray they've not blinded us to the terror stirring beneath the sands...</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy01" start="1" end="7" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy02">We set out to find the Field of Reeds, the blessed home of the gods.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy02" start="7" end="15" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy03">Carrying our dying queen, our only hope lay in finding the gift of immortality.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy03" start="16" end="23" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy04">We expected to discover divine power, a paradise blessed by the Nine.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy04" start="23" end="30" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy05">But we found only ruins and devastation, the obvious result of divine wrath.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy05" start="30" end="39" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy06">Having failed our queen, her body was consigned to the desert. But we would not be defeated.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy06" start="40" end="46" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy07">Allied with the might of Rome, we would succeed where our ancestors had failed.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy07" start="48" end="54" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy08">Like mighty Perseus or Achilles, General Crassus became our greatest champion.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy08" start="54" end="60" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy09">Together, our works inspired the people and brought order to the chaos.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy09" start="61" end="67" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy10">We would honor the gods and bring about an age of enlightenment.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy10" start="67" end="72" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy11">But greed and ambition poisoned the minds of our stewards. </string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy11" start="72" end="79" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy12">The Romans coveted the power of the gods and our protectors became our oppressors. </string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy12" start="81" end="85" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy13">The gods punished them for their arrogance.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy13" start="85" end="92" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy14">The Curse of Medusa would imprison the unfaithful for centuries.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy14" start="92" end="97" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy15">The faithful would have to prove ourselves worthy before the gods would return.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy15" start="97" end="105" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy16">But the plague of evil can never be vanquished. And it corrupts everything it touches.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy16" start="105" end="112" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy17">Now we pray that the gods will send new champions.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy17" start="113" end="118">To vanquish the darkness and find light in the shadows of our past.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising01" start="1" end="13" dialogue-next="TempestRising02">This island has always guarded the promise of paradise. Humanity cast out, deemed unworthy of such blessings.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising02" start="13" end="25" dialogue-next="TempestRising03">But I did not come here seeking paradise. I came for answers. Redemption after a life of weakness and suffering.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising03" start="25" end="32" dialogue-next="TempestRising04">And I found a truth that disproved everything I had been taught.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising04" start="32" end="43" dialogue-next="TempestRising05">I tasted the knowledge forbidden to us at creation. And I saw the vision of humanity's true potential.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising05" start="43" end="53" dialogue-next="TempestRising06">I knew then, I must correct this ancient injustice, and restore the power which is rightfully ours.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising06" start="55" end="61" dialogue-next="TempestRising07">The heart of the mountain now beats strong with this purpose.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising07" start="61" end="67" dialogue-next="TempestRising08">After a century of preparation, our campaign has begun.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising08" start="67" end="73" dialogue-next="TempestRising09">The islands townships already fall before the might of our armies.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising09" start="73" end="77" dialogue-next="TempestRising10">The only thing I had not foreseen is you.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising10" start="79" end="87" dialogue-next="TempestRising11">You who have stolen the gift meant for me. And now your soul will pay the price.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising11" start="87" end="100">For I will not stop until I have seized back the destiny stolen from us. And brought true freedom to the world both old and new.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress01" start="2" end="11" dialogue-next="WildHuntress02">Apophis is returned to the sands and Sutekh remains at rest. But the hunt has only just begun.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress02" start="13" end="22" dialogue-next="WildHuntress03">This hunt will be my greatest yet, the wretched mass of humanity my ultimate prey.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress03" start="22" end="29" dialogue-next="WildHuntress04">When we first appeared before them, humans were eager to learn, hungry for guidance.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress04" start="29" end="35" dialogue-next="WildHuntress05">We approached them in forms that were familiar and showered them with blessings.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress05" start="35" end="40" dialogue-next="WildHuntress06">But they lacked the purity shared by other creatures of these lands.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress06" start="40" end="50" dialogue-next="WildHuntress07">I warned my brethren, these beings were not worthy of eternal life. But the gift was bestowed nonetheless.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress07" start="50" end="56" dialogue-next="WildHuntress08">And what thanks did we receive? The fools turned against us.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress08" start="56" end="72" dialogue-next="WildHuntress09">I knew then, annihilation of the species was our only option.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress09" start="64" end="69" dialogue-next="WildHuntress10">But greater threats emerged, requiring our attention.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress10" start="69" end="76" dialogue-next="WildHuntress11">Years passed, we tried to live here in peace and harmony. </string>
	<string key="WildHuntress11" start="76" end="83" dialogue-next="WildHuntress12">But the twisted ambitions of humanity have reinvited disaster time and again.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress12" start="85" end="94" dialogue-next="WildHuntress13">Now, however, the power of the Ennead flows through the veins of Aeternum, fuel for my grim task.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress13" start="94" end="100" dialogue-next="WildHuntress14">I will undo the mistake my brethren made so long ago.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress14" start="100" end="108">I will revoke the gift, and restore your mortal birthright to a final and inevitable death.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone01" start="2" end="14" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone02">Long ago, a witch crept into the eastern fens. This was the Corpse Crone, and she cast a wicked spell.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone02" start="18" end="22" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone03">The deadly hex spread like a sickening plague.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone03" start="22" end="31" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone04">The island's immortality was twisted, made obscene. The Curse of the Lost would haunt our lands.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone04" start="31" end="40" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone05">The people sought salvation from this plague. Desperate, we believed conviction our only course.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone05" start="42" end="47" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone06">We discovered the soulless could hide amongst us.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone06" start="47" end="51" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone07">Committing them to the cold earth was the only answer.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone07" start="51" end="63" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone08">Eventually, the crone's purpose became clear. Her hex would bind the restless Lost to her will.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone08" start="63" end="76">To this day, her foul curse lingers. Until her evil can be forever extinguished.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret01" start="1" end="8" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret02">It was the dream of Avalon that led King Artorius to these shores.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret02" start="8" end="12" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret03">And of course, the wise counsel of the enchanter, Myrddin.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret03" start="12" end="22" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret04">But the enchanter became obsessed with the island's mysteries. An insidious evil claimed his soul.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret04" start="22" end="32" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret05">The Wars of Crimson Madness raged for a century. So many banners… All fallen to the Corruption.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret05" start="32" end="38" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret06">I know not what transpired to end the conflict.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret06" start="38" end="44" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret07">We found no answers as to Myrrdin's fate, no trace of the High King.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret07" start="44" end="51" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret08">I sought new peace and purpose here in the Brightwood.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret08" start="51" end="55" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret09">But it would not last. A plague of soulless Lost emerged.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret09" start="55" end="63" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret10">Brother Umberto and I formed the Bright Vigil to fight the darkness.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret10" start="63" end="68" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret11">But he stood alone when I left in search of my lord king.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret11" start="68" end="75" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret12">I returned empty handed, to witness the results of my failure.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret12" start="75" end="82">The Vigil, fallen to despair, and the Brightwood, bright no more.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth01" start="1" end="8" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth02">Aeternum's secrets called to us in dreams. Promising vast, ancient knowledge.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth02" start="8" end="15" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth03">What we discovered was an entity longing for release.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth03" start="15" end="18" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth04">Myrddin believed his spell-craft would ensure protection.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth04" start="18" end="24" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth05">But this fell power claimed him for its own.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth05" start="24" end="30" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth06">As the Crimson Sorcerer, he became the Herald of Madness.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth06" start="30" end="37" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth07">When all else failed, I confronted my brother. Our magics clashed...</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth07" start="37" end="42" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth08">And then silence. I was forever changed.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth08" start="43" end="53" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth09">I knew the Corruption would return. But the power I needed came at a terrible cost.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth09" start="55" end="62" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth10">The secrets I sought continued to elude me. But I refused to relent.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth10" start="62" end="73" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth11">I became the Corpse Crone, the Curse of Weaver's Fen. The target of foolish Shadow-Hunters.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth11" start="73" end="84">I spent the centuries since alone, preparing. When the Crimson Madness returns, I shall be ready.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter01" start="2" end="5" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter02">My father called me weak.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter02" start="5" end="9" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter03">I was ten when I proved him wrong.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter03" start="14" end="24" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter04">I chose the path of the warrior. And in two years, my brothers could not match me in battle.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter04" start="25" end="31" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter05">But among spear-daughters, I forged an unbreakable bond.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter05" start="31" end="34" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter06">On Aeternum, we fought an endless onslaught of darkness.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter06" start="39" end="47" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter07">Until that day, a faceless warlock cursed us. He stole our warrior's fire. </string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter07" start="50" end="56" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter08">We tried everything to break free, even death.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter08" start="56" end="60" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter09">But nothing worked... and without our strength, what were we?</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter09" start="60" end="68" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter10">Now, our enemies pursue an even darker power in Great Cleave. They must be stopped.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter10" start="68" end="76">Hero of Aeternum, help me reclaim our fire, and strike our enemy asunder. </string>
	<string key="TempestRisingMB01" start="1" end="7" dialogue-next="TempestRisingMB02">This island has always guarded the promise of paradise.</string>
	<string key="TempestRisingMB02" start="7" end="13" dialogue-next="TempestRisingMB03">Humanity cast out, deemed unworthy of such blessings.</string>
	<string key="TempestRisingMB03" start="13" end="21" dialogue-next="TempestRisingMB04">But I did not come here seeking paradise. I came for answers.</string>

	<string key="DevourerLegacy03" start="11" end="14" dialogue-next="DevourerLegacy04">Its meaning? "The Devourer."</string>
	<string key="DevourerLegacy04" start="15" end="23" dialogue-next="DevourerLegacy05">Vested with the power of the Titans, even the Ancients could not control them.</string>
	<string key="DevourerLegacy05" start="23" end="31" dialogue-next="DevourerLegacy06">But our tribe, the Blood of the Sands, earned their trust, learned to speak to them.</string>
	<string key="DevourerLegacy06" start="31" end="37" dialogue-next="DevourerLegacy07">And in time, we fought together in battle as one.</string>
	<string key="DevourerLegacy07" start="38" end="45" dialogue-next="DevourerLegacy08">We called them "šà-hul sahar," the heart of the desert.</string>
	<string key="DevourerLegacy08" start="45" end="52" dialogue-next="DevourerLegacy09">But when the Ancients vanished, the šà-hul retreated deep beneath the sands...</string>
	<string key="DevourerLegacy09" start="53" end="56" dialogue-next="DevourerLegacy10">We heard them, no more.</string>
	<string key="DevourerLegacy10" start="57" end="61" dialogue-next="DevourerLegacy11">Their eggs remained, but were plundered by the wicked.</string>
	<string key="DevourerLegacy11" start="62" end="66" dialogue-next="DevourerLegacy12">We failed in our duty to protect them.</string>
	<string key="DevourerLegacy12" start="67" end="75" dialogue-next="DevourerLegacy13">To preserve the last of the eggs, we sent forth bearers to hide them until the day of prophesy.</string>

	<string key="FallCaerDun03" start="11" end="18" dialogue-next="FallCaerDun04">Victorious, we returned here to heal and enjoy a moment of peace.</string>
	<string key="FallCaerDun04" start="17" end="24" dialogue-next="FallCaerDun05">But in the quiet of the night, that peace was shattered.</string>
	<string key="FallCaerDun05" start="24" end="32" dialogue-next="FallCaerDun06">The Corrupted washed over the fort in a wave – cutting and clawing, rending and tearing...</string>
	<string key="FallCaerDun06" start="32" end="36" dialogue-next="FallCaerDun07">Our newest recruits were butchered.</string>
	<string key="FallCaerDun07" start="37" end="46" dialogue-next="FallCaerDun08">I tried to help... Then that demon appeared, cutting down one after another. She would have finished me... </string>
	<string key="FallCaerDun08" start="46" end="50" dialogue-next="FallCaerDun09">She should have... But Yonas was there...</string>
	<string key="FallCaerDun09" start="50" end="57" dialogue-next="FallCaerDun10">Every ounce of his power, every swing and thrust, was to save us all.</string>
	<string key="FallCaerDun10" start="57" end="60" dialogue-next="FallCaerDun11">But she was too strong.</string>
	<string key="FallCaerDun11" start="60" end="65" dialogue-next="FallCaerDun12">She broke our fearless leader and dragged him away.</string>
	<string key="FallCaerDun12" start="66" end="72" dialogue-next="FallCaerDun13">Our fortress in ruins... the Soulwardens, crushed.</string>
	<string key="FallCaerDun13" start="72" end="80">We were too weak to stop them. There is nothing left.</string>
	<string key="BeastLords01" start="0" end="6" dialogue-next="BeastLords02">At the dawn of time, the Beast Lords were among the Titans who roamed the Earth.</string>
	<string key="BeastLords02" start="6" end="12" dialogue-next="BeastLords03">They existed in harmony, masters of the world in its natural state.</string>
	<string key="BeastLords03" start="12" end="18" dialogue-next="BeastLords04">When the Ancients arrived, they sought dominion over all,</string>
	<string key="BeastLords04" start="18" end="27" dialogue-next="BeastLords05">But the newcomers soon discovered Earth's primal children could not be tamed.</string>
	<string key="BeastLords05" start="27" end="34" dialogue-next="BeastLords06">I walked among humans at that time and received the Ancients' immortal gifts.</string>
	<string key="BeastLords06" start="34" end="39" dialogue-next="BeastLords07">I became their emissary to the primal world.</string>
	<string key="BeastLords07" start="39" end="47" dialogue-next="BeastLords08">During the Ancients' Civil War, I fought alongside Artemis against the Corruption.</string>
	<string key="BeastLords08" start="47" end="54" dialogue-next="BeastLords09">But the Beast Lords stayed out of the fray, withdrawing to their underworld realm.</string>
	<string key="BeastLords09" start="54" end="57" dialogue-next="BeastLords10">Taking with them the Tear of Gaea,</string>
	<string key="BeastLords10" start="57" end="62" dialogue-next="BeastLords11">Safekeeping its potential to transform the Earth.</string>
	<string key="BeastLords11" start="63" end="70" dialogue-next="BeastLords12">Millennia later, the Huntress called on me to fight at her side once again...</string>
	<string key="BeastLords12" start="70" end="76" dialogue-next="BeastLords13">Promising to restore the natural order and the Beast Lords to their place.</string>
	<string key="BeastLords13" start="77" end="84" dialogue-next="BeastLords14">But her powers seem to have inspired a strange fury...</string>
	<string key="BeastLords14" start="84" end="92">One I fear could become a destructive rage that threatens all Aeternum.</string>
	<string key="NewEden01" start="0" end="6" dialogue-next="NewEden02">It began when the Ennead awakened, its power moving through the earth.</string>
	<string key="NewEden02" start="6" end="13" dialogue-next="NewEden03">Its light erupting from the tower here in terrible glory.</string>
	<string key="NewEden03" start="14" end="20" dialogue-next="NewEden04">Daring to investigate, they witnessed a hideous transformation...</string>
	<string key="NewEden04" start="20" end="26" dialogue-next="NewEden05">Artemis created an ally, one whose gaze turned flesh to stone.</string>
	<string key="NewEden05" start="27" end="33" dialogue-next="NewEden06">As the Ancient's terror spread, the people of the settlement staged a final stand...</string>
	<string key="NewEden06" start="33" end="37" dialogue-next="NewEden07">But the flora of First Light twisted... and turned against them.</string>
	<string key="NewEden07" start="38" end="43" dialogue-next="NewEden08">The defeated were told they had a greater purpose to serve...</string>
	<string key="NewEden08" start="43" end="50" dialogue-next="NewEden09">Their fates and spirits would be bound... to the birthing of a new world.</string>
	<string key="NewEden09" start="50" end="55" dialogue-next="NewEden10">It appears Artemis then called forth a beastly horde.</string>
	<string key="NewEden10" start="55" end="61" dialogue-next="NewEden11">Primal creatures summoned from some abyssal realm.</string>
	<string key="NewEden11" start="61" end="68" dialogue-next="NewEden12">What followed is madness... obscene acts to make amalgamations of people, beasts, and plants...</string>
	<string key="NewEden12" start="69" end="76" dialogue-next="NewEden13">Our witness, in soulstruck horror, took flight in body... and in mind.</string>
	<string key="NewEden13" start="76" end="83" dialogue-next="NewEden14">Her sanity is now shattered by this mad Ancient's vision for the future.</string>
	<string key="NewEden14" start="83" end="89">A savage Eden where humanity has no place.</string>
	<string key="ShadowAwakens01" start="1" end="7" dialogue-next="ShadowAwakens02">Since the beginning, I have sacrificed to protect the Earth.</string>
	<string key="ShadowAwakens02" start="7" end="16" dialogue-next="ShadowAwakens03">Watching my brothers and sisters yield their very essence to stem the first tide of evil.</string>
	<string key="ShadowAwakens03" start="17" end="28" dialogue-next="ShadowAwakens04">Upon its return, I sought to restore the garden, and to redeem humanity as Corruption's accomplice.</string>
	<string key="ShadowAwakens04" start="29" end="37" dialogue-next="ShadowAwakens05">But you prevented that... and invited perils far greater than you can imagine.</string>
	<string key="ShadowAwakens05" start="37" end="44" dialogue-next="ShadowAwakens06">Your allies go forth, bearing a power never meant for human hands.</string>
	<string key="ShadowAwakens06" start="44" end="49" dialogue-next="ShadowAwakens07">Oblivious to the horrors it summons from the shadows.</string>
	<string key="ShadowAwakens07" start="49" end="54" dialogue-next="ShadowAwakens08">The Beast Lords are but the vanguard for savage legions...</string>
	<string key="ShadowAwakens08" start="54" end="59" dialogue-next="ShadowAwakens09">And they will hunt you down to reclaim their prize.</string>
	<string key="ShadowAwakens09" start="60" end="69" dialogue-next="ShadowAwakens10">A darkness unseen for centuries awakens with an insatiable thirst...</string>
	<string key="ShadowAwakens10" start="70" end="79" dialogue-next="ShadowAwakens11">And above all, the specter of time looms, seeking to claim its toll on Aeternum.</string>
	<string key="ShadowAwakens11" start="79" end="87">At long-last, judgement comes for the island of immortals.</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand01" start="1" end="7" dialogue-next="DarkCommand02">Neither duty nor divine purpose called me from the Old World...</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand02" start="7" end="16" dialogue-next="DarkCommand03">I sailed into oblivion as master of my own destiny... fearless in my command.</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand03" start="16" end="23" dialogue-next="DarkCommand04">And I found here that which I sought, the truth of power...</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand04" start="23" end="29" dialogue-next="DarkCommand05">To which I proudly swore my eternal allegiance.</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand05" start="30" end="35" dialogue-next="DarkCommand06">I began anew, authority and identity stripped away,</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand06" start="35" end="43" dialogue-next="DarkCommand07">Embracing inhuman toil and suffering as the path to my return.</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand07" start="43" end="49" dialogue-next="DarkCommand08">Time came when I could again prove my prowess in battle.</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand08" start="49" end="56" dialogue-next="DarkCommand09">No man nor demon could withstand my newfound might.</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand09" start="56" end="61" dialogue-next="DarkCommand10">My dominion established, a new destiny earned...</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand10" start="62" end="69" dialogue-next="DarkCommand11">The voice of truth pronounced ME as champion of our righteous cause.</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand11" start="69" end="75" dialogue-next="DarkCommand12">And I led our armies to victory again and again...</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand12" start="75" end="81" dialogue-next="DarkCommand13">The remnants of ragged humanity crushed along the way...</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand13" start="82" end="88" dialogue-next="DarkCommand14">To bring me here, to the precipice of my ultimate achievement.</string>
	<string key="DarkCommand14" start="88" end="97">The forces of this world and those beyond... now under my command.</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret01" start="1" end="4" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret02">I can never forget the glory of that day.</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret02" start="4" end="8" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret03">You would sail for Avalon with a new member of the Round Table-</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret03" start="8" end="18" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret04">-Ser Mordred. I can still feel the cold weight of Excalibur on my shoulder.</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret04" start="18" end="23" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret05">But you only loved those who did not love you.</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret05" start="23" end="28" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret06">Blind to Myrddin's deceit, you thought me the traitor.</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret06" start="28" end="35" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret07">To save you, I would find proof. Even a way to turn my uncle's magic against him.</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret07" start="35" end="41" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret08">But Mother stopped me, though she knew the truth.</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret08" start="42" end="47" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret09">When the Crimson Sorceror marched on Prydwen and sundered the Round Table-</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret09" start="47" end="56" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret10">You blamed me. You took everything. Title. Honor. Home.</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret10" start="57" end="63" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret11">Why? Why cast me away when I would give you everything?</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret11" start="64" end="71" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret12">And then it came to me. It was so simple.</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret12" start="72" end="77" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret13">The power I sought was never meant for you, Artorius.</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret13" start="77" end="80" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret14">It was meant for me.</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret14" start="80" end="86" dialogue-next="MordredsRegret15">Be glad, for I will rule as you could not.</string>
	<string key="MordredsRegret15" start="86" end="95">By Ring and Frosted Crown, Avalon, and all this cold world shall come crashing down.</string>
