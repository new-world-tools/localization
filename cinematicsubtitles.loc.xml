	<string key="TempestReckoning03" start="13" end="19" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning04">Abandoned by the power for which she traded everything.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning04" start="19" end="22" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning05">The Soulwardens were victorious...</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning05" start="22" end="29" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning06">Pulling Aeternum, and the world, back from the precipice of doom.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning06" start="29" end="32" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning07">But at what cost?</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning07" start="32" end="38" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning08">So many of their numbers Corrupted or Lost.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning08" start="39" end="45" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning09">Their fragile alliance crumbling as the factions fight for dominance.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning09" start="47" end="53" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning10">And what of the allies they believe they've gained in the Angry Earth?</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning10" start="53" end="56" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning11">It will be clear soon enough...</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning11" start="56" end="62" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning12">That the vengeful hand of nature would grasp far more than equilibrium.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning12" start="64" end="72" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning13">And the void exposed when the surge in Corruption abates will become a threat of itself...</string>

	<string key="TempestReckoning14" start="80" end="85" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning15">to find purpose and power in a source as yet unrealized.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning15" start="86" end="97" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning16">Yes, the hapless inhabitants of Aeternum will soon learn that this chapter may have come to a close...</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning16" start="97" end="105" speaker="Father Russo">But the real horrors have just begun.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy01" start="1" end="5" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy02">The gods summoned us from the Old World.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy02" start="5" end="11" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy03">Calling us to paradise, the undying land, they promised life eternal.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy03" start="13" end="20" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy04">The divine Ancients shared their wisdom, directing us to build great temples to house their wonders.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy04" start="21" end="26" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy05">The works of my people shone like a jewel in this New World.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy05" start="27" end="33" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy06">But madness erupted throughout the land, igniting a terrible war.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy06" start="34" end="37" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy07">Our great works were laid to waste.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy07" start="38" end="43" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy08">When the fires cooled, the Ancients had vanished.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy08" start="43" end="50" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy09">Leaving behind only ruins and a doomed race of immortal soldiers guarding empty temples.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy09" start="51" end="54" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy10">But we were determined to endure.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy10" start="56" end="62" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy11">In the absence of the Ancients, we became the masters of our own destiny.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy11" start="63" end="67" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy12">We battled the primordial beings birthed by the cataclysm.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy12" start="67" end="76" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy13">And discovered immortality became a curse. Death had not been banished, only transformed.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy13" start="78" end="81" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy14">Even the madness returned to plague us anew.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy14" start="83" end="92" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy15">In the end, the Ancients' promises had been nothing but lies.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy15" start="94" end="102" speaker="Imhotep">I pray they've not blinded us to the terror stirring beneath the sands...</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy01" start="1" end="7" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy02">We set out to find the Field of Reeds, the blessed home of the gods.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy02" start="7" end="15" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy03">Carrying our dying queen, our only hope lay in finding the gift of immortality.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy03" start="16" end="23" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy04">We expected to discover divine power, a paradise blessed by the Nine.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy04" start="23" end="30" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy05">But we found only ruins and devastation, the obvious result of divine wrath.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy05" start="30" end="39" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy06">Having failed our queen, her body was consigned to the desert. But we would not be defeated.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy06" start="40" end="46" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy07">Allied with the might of Rome, we would succeed where our ancestors had failed.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy07" start="48" end="54" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy08">Like mighty Perseus or Achilles, General Crassus became our greatest champion.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy08" start="54" end="60" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy09">Together, our works inspired the people and brought order to the chaos.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy09" start="61" end="67" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy10">We would honor the gods and bring about an age of enlightenment.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy10" start="67" end="72" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy11">But greed and ambition poisoned the minds of our stewards. </string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy11" start="72" end="79" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy12">The Romans coveted the power of the gods and our protectors became our oppressors. </string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy12" start="81" end="85" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy13">The gods punished them for their arrogance.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy13" start="85" end="92" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy14">The Curse of Medusa would imprison the unfaithful for centuries.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy14" start="92" end="97" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy15">The faithful would have to prove ourselves worthy before the gods would return.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy15" start="97" end="105" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy16">But the plague of evil can never be vanquished. And it corrupts everything it touches.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy16" start="105" end="112" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy17">Now we pray that the gods will send new champions.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy17" start="113" end="118" speaker="Pontifex Charmion">To vanquish the darkness and find light in the shadows of our past.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising01" start="1" end="13" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising02">This island has always guarded the promise of paradise. Humanity cast out, deemed unworthy of such blessings.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising02" start="13" end="25" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising03">But I did not come here seeking paradise. I came for answers. Redemption after a life of weakness and suffering.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising03" start="25" end="32" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising04">And I found a truth that disproved everything I had been taught.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising04" start="32" end="43" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising05">I tasted the knowledge forbidden to us at creation. And I saw the vision of humanity's true potential.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising05" start="43" end="53" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising06">I knew then, I must correct this ancient injustice, and restore the power which is rightfully ours.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising06" start="55" end="61" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising07">The heart of the mountain now beats strong with this purpose.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising07" start="61" end="67" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising08">After a century of preparation, our campaign has begun.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising08" start="67" end="73" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising09">The island's townships already fall before the might of our armies.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising09" start="73" end="77" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising10">The only thing I had not foreseen is you.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising10" start="79" end="87" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising11">You who have stolen the gift meant for me. And now your soul will pay the price.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising11" start="87" end="100" speaker="Mysterious Voice">For I will not stop until I have seized back the destiny stolen from us. And brought true freedom to the world both old and new.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress01" start="2.8" end="11.5" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress02">Apophis is returned to the sands and Sutekh remains at rest. But the hunt has only just begun.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress02" start="13.3" end="21.3" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress03">This hunt will be my greatest yet, the wretched mass of humanity my ultimate prey.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress03" start="22.7" end="29" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress04">When we first appeared before them, humans were eager to learn, hungry for guidance.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress04" start="29.8" end="35" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress05">We approached them in forms that were familiar and showered them with blessings.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress05" start="36.1" end="40.2" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress06">But they lacked the purity shared by other creatures of these lands.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress06" start="41.2" end="50.3" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress07">I warned my brethren, these beings were not worthy of eternal life. But the gift was bestowed nonetheless.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress07" start="51" end="56.2" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress08">And what thanks did we receive? The fools turned against us.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress08" start="57.2" end="63" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress09">I knew then, annihilation of the species was our only option.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress09" start="65.5" end="70" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress10">But greater threats emerged, requiring our attention.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress10" start="71" end="76" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress11">Years passed, we tried to live here in peace and harmony. </string>
	<string key="WildHuntress11" start="77" end="83.6" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress12">But the twisted ambitions of humanity have reinvited disaster time and again.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress12" start="85.5" end="94" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress13">Now, however, the power of the Ennead flows through the veins of Aeternum, fuel for my grim task.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress13" start="95" end="99" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress14">I will undo the mistake my brethren made so long ago.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress14" start="100" end="108.3" speaker="Artemis">I will revoke the gift, and restore your mortal birthright to a final and inevitable death.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone01" start="2" end="14" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone02">Long ago, a witch crept into the eastern fens. This was the Corpse Crone, and she cast a wicked spell.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone02" start="18" end="22" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone03">The deadly hex spread like a sickening plague.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone03" start="22" end="31" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone04">The island's immortality was twisted, made obscene. The Curse of the Lost would haunt our lands.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone04" start="31" end="40" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone05">The people sought salvation from this plague. Desperate, we believed conviction our only course.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone05" start="42" end="47" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone06">We discovered the soulless could hide amongst us.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone06" start="47" end="51" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone07">Committing them to the cold earth was the only answer.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone07" start="51" end="63" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone08">Eventually, the crone's purpose became clear. Her hex would bind the restless Lost to her will.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone08" start="63" end="76" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather">To this day, her foul curse lingers. Until her evil can be forever extinguished.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret01" start="1" end="8" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret02">It was the dream of Avalon that led King Artorius to these shores.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret02" start="8" end="12" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret03">And of course, the wise counsel of the enchanter, Myrddin.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret03" start="12" end="22" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret04">But the enchanter became obsessed with the island's mysteries. An insidious evil claimed his soul.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret04" start="22" end="32" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret05">The Wars of Crimson Madness raged for a century. So many banners… All fallen to the Corruption.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret05" start="32" end="38" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret06">I know not what transpired to end the conflict.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret06" start="38" end="44" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret07">We found no answers as to Myrrdin's fate, no trace of the High King.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret07" start="44" end="51" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret08">I sought new peace and purpose here in the Brightwood.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret08" start="51" end="55" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret09">But it would not last. A plague of soulless Lost emerged.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret09" start="55" end="63" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret10">Brother Umberto and I formed the Bright Vigil to fight the darkness.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret10" start="63" end="68" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret11">But he stood alone when I left in search of my lord king.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret11" start="68" end="75" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret12">I returned empty handed, to witness the results of my failure.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret12" start="75" end="82" speaker="Ser Galahad">The Vigil, fallen to despair, and the Brightwood, bright no more.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth01" start="1" end="8" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth02">Aeternum's secrets called to us in dreams. Promising vast, ancient knowledge.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth02" start="8" end="15" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth03">What we discovered was an entity longing for release.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth03" start="15" end="18" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth04">Myrddin believed his spell-craft would ensure protection.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth04" start="18" end="24" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth05">But this fell power claimed him for its own.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth05" start="24" end="30" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth06">As the Crimson Sorcerer, he became the Herald of Madness.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth06" start="30" end="37" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth07">When all else failed, I confronted my brother. Our magics clashed...</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth07" start="37" end="42" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth08">And then silence. I was forever changed.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth08" start="43" end="53" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth09">I knew the Corruption would return. But the power I needed came at a terrible cost.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth09" start="55" end="62" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth10">The secrets I sought continued to elude me. But I refused to relent.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth10" start="62" end="73" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth11">I became the Corpse Crone, the Curse of Weaver's Fen. The target of foolish Shadow-Hunters.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth11" start="73" end="84" speaker="Morgaine">I spent the centuries since alone, preparing. When the Crimson Madness returns, I shall be ready.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter01" start="2" end="5" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter02">My father called me weak.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter02" start="5" end="9" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter03">I was ten when I proved him wrong.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter03" start="14" end="24" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter04">I chose the path of the warrior. And in two years, my brothers could not match me in battle.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter04" start="25" end="31" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter05">But among spear-daughters, I forged an unbreakable bond.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter05" start="31" end="34" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter06">On Aeternum, we fought an endless onslaught of darkness.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter06" start="39" end="47" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter07">Until that day, a faceless warlock cursed us. He stole our warrior's fire. </string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter07" start="50" end="56" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter08">We tried everything to break free, even death.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter08" start="56" end="60" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter09">But nothing worked... and without our strength, what were we?</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter09" start="60" end="68" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter10">Now, our enemies pursue an even darker power in Great Cleave. They must be stopped.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter10" start="68" end="76" speaker="Skye">Hero of Aeternum, help me reclaim our fire, and strike our enemy asunder. </string>
	<string key="TempestRisingMB01" start="1" end="7" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRisingMB02">This island has always guarded the promise of paradise.</string>

	<string key="EmptyThrone02" start="10.6" end="17.7" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="EmptyThrone03">Promising order, he united Southern Aeternum for the first time since the era of the Ancients.</string>
	<string key="EmptyThrone03" start="20.2" end="25.2" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="EmptyThrone04">The king's rule was built upon the armor-clad shoulders of his sworn knights:</string>
	<string key="EmptyThrone04" start="26" end="32.7" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="EmptyThrone05">Courageous Ser Gawain, fierce Ser Lancelot, and the loyal Ser Galahad.</string>
	<string key="EmptyThrone05" start="34.2" end="38.7" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="EmptyThrone06">Their valor was tested when hordes of Corrupted attacked from the north...</string>
	<string key="EmptyThrone06" start="39" end="46.7" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="EmptyThrone07">Guided by none other than the king's fallen advisor, the wizard Myrddin.</string>
	<string key="EmptyThrone07" start="50.2" end="57.1" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="EmptyThrone08">In the wake of the conflict, King Artorius was gone, fate unknown as the kingdom crumbled.</string>
	<string key="EmptyThrone08" start="57.5" end="63.5" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="EmptyThrone09">Lancelot left seeking vengeance and Galahad to create a new life...</string>
	<string key="EmptyThrone09" start="64" end="71.7" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="EmptyThrone10">But Ser Gawain was heir to the throne - he departed seeking only divine blessing for his rule.</string>
	<string key="EmptyThrone10" start="73.2" end="78" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="EmptyThrone11">Prydwen was in a dire state, ravaged by war, its people demoralized.</string>
	<string key="EmptyThrone11" start="79.5" end="85.7" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="EmptyThrone12">It was Minister Lochnir who held the town together, safeguarding the throne for Gawain's return.</string>
	<string key="EmptyThrone12" start="88.2" end="93.6" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="EmptyThrone13">But Ser Jin Jae of Ebonscale Reach captured the hearts of the people.</string>
	<string key="EmptyThrone13" start="94.2" end="101.8" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="EmptyThrone14">After so many dark years, she emerged as a beacon of hope, and was appointed Knight-Regent.</string>
	<string key="EmptyThrone14" start="103" end="107.3" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="EmptyThrone15">Now the Minister informs us he's spotted Ser Gawain's sails on the horizon...</string>
	<string key="EmptyThrone15" start="109.8" end="116" speaker="Sage Moira">And we prepare for the true heir to finally come home and claim his throne.</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum01" start="0.5" end="7" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="AncientAeternum02">Aeternum's ruins tell the tale of a magnificent civilization that once dominated the island.</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum02" start="8" end="15" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="AncientAeternum03">Its architects, the Ancients, discovered - or possibly created - the energy we call Azoth.</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum03" start="16" end="26" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="AncientAeternum04">In the millennia that followed, humanity came from countless prehistoric cultures - Sumeria, China, Egypt, and more.</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum04" start="27" end="32" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="AncientAeternum05">They were called to explore the sea... summoned by the Ancients to this island.</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum05" start="34" end="37" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="AncientAeternum06">These early arrivals worshiped the Ancients as gods.</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum06" start="37.5" end="43" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="AncientAeternum07">They toiled under the Ancients' guidance, building hundreds of monuments and towers.</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum07" start="44" end="50.5" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="AncientAeternum08">But humanity's savage nature could not be tamed. Wars broke out...</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum08" start="51" end="56" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="AncientAeternum09">And amid the chaos, Corruption first appeared.</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum09" start="58" end="64" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="AncientAeternum10">To combat this new menace, the Ancients imbued a chosen few with gifts.</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum10" start="65" end="70" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="AncientAeternum11">These heroes were granted monumental powers... and life eternal.</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum11" start="71" end="76.5" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="AncientAeternum12">The wars raged on for centuries, and the Ancients' blessed entire armies...</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum12" start="77" end="83" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="AncientAeternum13">But most of the human vessels degraded into mindless skeletal warriors.</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum13" start="85" end="89.5" speaker="Sage Moira" dialogue-next="AncientAeternum14">Those wars ended millennia ago, and the Ancients disappeared.</string>
	<string key="AncientAeternum14" start="90" end="98" speaker="Sage Moira">But their haunted Guardians still protect the ruins, oblivious to the fact their cause has long since lost its meaning.</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens01" start="1" end="5" speaker="Yonas Alazar" dialogue-next="FallSoulwardens02">We were not the first to stand against the Corrupted.</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens02" start="5.5" end="12.5" speaker="Yonas Alazar" dialogue-next="FallSoulwardens03">Heroes of a lost age once harnessed the magic of the Ancients to defend Aeternum.</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens03" start="13" end="21" speaker="Yonas Alazar" dialogue-next="FallSoulwardens04">Delving into a tomb of legend, we found the ancient rites those heroes employed...</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens04" start="21.5" end="26" speaker="Yonas Alazar" dialogue-next="FallSoulwardens05">And the Soulwarden Order was born.</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens05" start="28" end="36.5" speaker="Yonas Alazar" dialogue-next="FallSoulwardens06">Harnessing the Ancients' magics, Romano blessed us with a bulwark against Corruption's influence.</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens06" start="37" end="45" speaker="Yonas Alazar" dialogue-next="FallSoulwardens07">But this gift came at great sacrifice. We would never be the same again.</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens07" start="46" end="51" speaker="Yonas Alazar" dialogue-next="FallSoulwardens08">Our newfound powers carried us to many victories...</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens08" start="51.5" end="57" speaker="Yonas Alazar" dialogue-next="FallSoulwardens09">I began to believe we could actually vanquish the Corrupted.</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens09" start="58" end="66.5" speaker="Yonas Alazar" dialogue-next="FallSoulwardens10">But the Crimson Sorcerer was a wily foe. He learned our secrets and exploited them.</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens10" start="67" end="74" speaker="Yonas Alazar" dialogue-next="FallSoulwardens11">One by one, my fellow Wardens became Corrupted.</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens11" start="75" end="86" speaker="Yonas Alazar" dialogue-next="FallSoulwardens12">The tower of Arcturus is where we made our stand. In a final act of desperation, Constanza and I would leap from the heights.</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens12" start="87" end="92" speaker="Yonas Alazar" dialogue-next="FallSoulwardens13">But in the end, I was alone.</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens13" start="95" end="105" speaker="Yonas Alazar" dialogue-next="FallSoulwardens14">I have tried to honor the memory of my fallen friends, but the memories are too much.</string>
	<string key="FallSoulwardens14" start="106" end="114" speaker="Yonas Alazar">I am no longer a Soulwarden. There are no Soulwardens anymore.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute01" start="1" end="9" speaker="Nessa Harrower" dialogue-next="MedeasTribute02">Two-thousand years ago, cataclysmic wars between Aeternum's earliest civilizations ravaged these southern plains.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute02" start="10" end="16.5" speaker="Nessa Harrower" dialogue-next="MedeasTribute03">The sorceress Medea came to Windsward in the wars' aftermath, determined to restore this land.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute03" start="18" end="23.5" speaker="Nessa Harrower" dialogue-next="MedeasTribute04">Though the Ancients were gone, Medea had learned many of their secrets.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute04" start="24" end="31.5" speaker="Nessa Harrower" dialogue-next="MedeasTribute05">She channeled Azoth to create the Verdant Gemstones. These would shield and heal her new domain.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute05" start="33" end="38.5" speaker="Nessa Harrower" dialogue-next="MedeasTribute06">The Elder Druids arrived centuries later to discover what had become a bountiful land.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute06" start="39" end="47" speaker="Nessa Harrower" dialogue-next="MedeasTribute07">With Medea's blessing, they tended to the plants and animals, and Windsward flourished to new heights.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute07" start="49" end="56.5" speaker="Nessa Harrower" dialogue-next="MedeasTribute08">But as centuries passed, the Sorceress developed new ambitions, seeking to claim realms previously beyond her reach.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute08" start="57" end="65" speaker="Nessa Harrower" dialogue-next="MedeasTribute09">The Verdant Gemstones were left in the druids' care; this would now be their garden, their responsibility.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute09" start="66" end="73.5" speaker="Nessa Harrower" dialogue-next="MedeasTribute10">But the wrath of the Angry Earth struck soon thereafter, and the druids were hopelessly outmatched.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute10" start="74.5" end="81.5" speaker="Nessa Harrower" dialogue-next="MedeasTribute11">Medea returned with a fury, purging every last baleful sprig, rescuing Windsward once more.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute11" start="83" end="89.5" speaker="Nessa Harrower" dialogue-next="MedeasTribute12">For their failure, the druids' exclusive claim was rescinded, and settlers came to Corinth.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute12" start="90" end="97.5" speaker="Nessa Harrower" dialogue-next="MedeasTribute13">Medea demanded a tribute for her continued protection, hiring the Iron Rose Mercenaries to deliver it.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute13" start="100" end="110.5" speaker="Nessa Harrower" dialogue-next="MedeasTribute14">Now it seems... something has gone awry yet again. I return home to find our land suffering, and my fellow druids with it.</string>
	<string key="MedeasTribute14" start="111" end="121" speaker="Nessa Harrower">Druidic blessings turned to curses. Bounty turned to famine. And life withering away, no hope in sight.</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro01" start="2" end="4" speaker="Grace O'Malley" dialogue-next="TroubleOxboro02">This town is much older than it looks.</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro02" start="5" end="11" speaker="Grace O'Malley" dialogue-next="TroubleOxboro03">Believe it or not, it was the bleeding Roman Legions that first made it into a proper village.</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro03" start="12" end="19" speaker="Grace O'Malley" dialogue-next="TroubleOxboro04">But it soon became a trading hub for all sorts... the crossroads of Aeternum, and so it was.</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro04" start="20" end="26" speaker="Grace O'Malley" dialogue-next="TroubleOxboro05">People coming from all over to buy and sell, and the gold in the town's coffers piled up.</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro05" start="27" end="33" speaker="Grace O'Malley" dialogue-next="TroubleOxboro06">The trade barons ran the place for profit; no kings, no queens, and no messing.</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro06" start="34" end="38" speaker="Grace O'Malley" dialogue-next="TroubleOxboro07">Each of the town's factions had its own enforcers, and for a while that seemed to work.</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro07" start="41" end="45" speaker="Grace O'Malley" dialogue-next="TroubleOxboro08">But it was just a matter of time until vice and greed turned to violence.</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro08" start="46" end="50" speaker="Grace O'Malley" dialogue-next="TroubleOxboro09">Fighting broke out in the streets, and the whole town burned down.</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro09" start="52" end="59" speaker="Grace O'Malley" dialogue-next="TroubleOxboro10">But coin has a way of fixing things fast - out of the ashes, the town of Oxboro came to life.</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro10" start="61" end="65" speaker="Grace O'Malley" dialogue-next="TroubleOxboro11">The trade barons built it back: bigger, stronger, and more profitable than ever.</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro11" start="66" end="69" speaker="Grace O'Malley" dialogue-next="TroubleOxboro12">And word is it's been smooth sailing ever since.</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro12" start="71" end="76" speaker="Grace O'Malley" dialogue-next="TroubleOxboro13">Even when the Corruption spread across the land centuries ago, Oxboro was still sitting pretty.</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro13" start="78" end="84" speaker="Grace O'Malley" dialogue-next="TroubleOxboro14">These days, coin's flowing like never before, but the trade barons hoard their wealth from the shadows...</string>
	<string key="TroubleOxboro14" start="86" end="94" speaker="Grace O'Malley">It may be tricky, but there's a fortune to be made here, and Grace O'Malley won't be leaving until she gets her share.</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza01" start="1" end="3.7" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza02">Fortune favors the bold.</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza02" start="6" end="11.4" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza03">And nary was there a captain and crew as brave - or feared - as ours.</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza03" start="13.5" end="15.4" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza04">We were unstoppable.</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza04" start="17" end="21.7" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza05">Until the phantom galleon "Esperanza" appeared on the horizon.</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza05" start="25" end="31" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza06">Aye... we knew the ship well. Story went she plundered a legendary island.</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza06" start="31.8" end="33.4" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza07">And was never seen again.</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza07" start="37" end="47" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza08">On board, the wind was still - the Esperanza's crew entombed within, all slaughtered by an unknown hand...</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza08" start="47.8" end="55.4" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza09">Our courage rewarded - the most legendary treasure in the southern seas was ours to claim.</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza09" start="57.5" end="65.2" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza10">That evening, as we celebrated our newfound wealth, treacherous thoughts took hold...</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza10" start="67" end="72.5" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza11">I was awakened in the night to sounds of pistol fire, a mutiny under way.</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza11" start="74" end="77.4" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza12">I rushed through smoke and flame to the Captain's quarters.</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza12" start="78" end="82" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza13">But I was too late... the Captain was already slain.</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza13" start="84" end="90.7" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza14">When I reached the deck, all was lost. We’d sailed into the heart of a hellish storm...</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza14" start="92" end="97" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza15">Our ill fortune ran us aground on the ragged coast of Aeternum.</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza15" start="100.8" end="106.7" speaker="Grimm" dialogue-next="LaEsperanza16">I was the only survivor... and the treasure, scattered along the shore.</string>
	<string key="LaEsperanza16" start="107.7" end="116.2" speaker="Grimm">Fortune favors the bold... but those cursed doubloons will bring naught but a wealth of horror.</string>
	<string key="Intro_A_01" start="26" end="31.2" speaker="Sailor" dialogue-next="Intro_A_02">I don’t like it. Sailin' to an uncharted island with strange folk aboard--</string>
	<string key="Intro_A_02" start="32.1" end="35.1" speaker="Deckhand" dialogue-next="Intro_A_03">Keep yer voice down! Lest ye want the cap’n ta hear ye.</string>
	<string key="Intro_A_03" start="36.1" end="44" speaker="Sailor" dialogue-next="Intro_A_04">It ain’t the Captain I’m worried about, it’s that priest... If he’s a man of the cloth I’m the Virgin Mary.</string>
	<string key="Intro_A_04" start="55.1" end="58" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="Intro_A_05">All you seek will soon be yours, Captain.</string>
	<string key="Intro_A_05" start="58.2" end="61.3" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="Intro_A_06">It is indeed the island of legend.</string>
	<string key="Intro_A_06" start="63" end="64.2" speaker="Captain Thorpe" dialogue-next="Intro_A_07">So you say...</string>
	<string key="Intro_A_07" start="65.2" end="78.1" speaker="Captain Thorpe" dialogue-next="Intro_A_08">If you’re wrong, the price of the voyage will be paid in blood. Yours and those vagabonds you’ve brought along.</string>
	<string key="Intro_A_08" start="78.2" end="80.2" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="Intro_A_09">They merely seek adventure, Captain.</string>
	<string key="Intro_A_09" start="81.3" end="86.1" speaker="Father Russo">The island calls to those who choose to forge their own destiny.</string>
	<string key="Intro_B_01" start="6.2" end="8.1" speaker="Captain Thorpe" dialogue-next="Intro_B_02">You lied to me, priest!</string>
	<string key="Intro_B_02" start="8.4" end="11.2" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="Intro_B_03">I warned you the journey would be difficult.</string>
	<string key="Intro_B_03" start="12.3" end="16.9" speaker="Captain Thorpe" dialogue-next="Intro_B_04">You said nothing about sailing through the very gates of Hell!</string>
	<string key="Intro_B_04" start="18.6" end="25" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="Intro_B_05">Hell is all but inevitable for one such as you, Aldous Thorpe.</string>
	<string key="Intro_B_05" start="26" end="30" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="Intro_B_06">The island offers something much greater than gold...</string>
	<string key="Intro_B_06" start="31.5" end="33.1" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="Intro_B_07">Redemption...</string>
	<string key="Intro_B_07" start="33.6" end="38.6" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="Intro_B_08">For me and perhaps... even for you.</string>
	<string key="Intro_B_08" start="39.8" end="41.8" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="Intro_B_09">Do not fear the storm, Captain.</string>
