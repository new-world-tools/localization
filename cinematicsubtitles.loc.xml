	<string key="TempestReckoning02" start="4" end="12" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning03">The heart of the Tempest, Captain Isabella herself, defeated...</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning03" start="13" end="19" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning04">Abandoned by the power for which she traded everything.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning04" start="19" end="22" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning05">The Soulwardens were victorious...</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning05" start="22" end="29" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning06">Pulling Aeternum, and the world, back from the precipice of doom.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning06" start="29" end="32" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning07">But at what cost?</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning07" start="32" end="38" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning08">So many of their numbers Corrupted or Lost.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning08" start="39" end="45" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning09">Their fragile alliance crumbling as the factions fight for dominance.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning09" start="47" end="53" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning10">And what of the allies they believe they've gained in the Angry Earth?</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning10" start="53" end="56" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning11">It will be clear soon enough...</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning11" start="56" end="62" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning12">That the vengeful hand of nature would grasp far more than equilibrium.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning12" start="64" end="72" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning13">And the void exposed when the surge in Corruption abates will become a threat of itself...</string>

	<string key="TempestReckoning14" start="80" end="85" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning15">to find purpose and power in a source as yet unrealized.</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning15" start="86" end="97" speaker="Father Russo" dialogue-next="TempestReckoning16">Yes, the hapless inhabitants of Aeternum will soon learn that this chapter maye have come to a close...</string>
	<string key="TempestReckoning16" start="97" end="105" speaker="Father Russo">But the real horrors have just begun.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy01" start="1" end="5" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy02">The gods summoned us from the Old World.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy02" start="5" end="11" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy03">Calling us to paradise, the undying land, they promised life eternal.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy03" start="13" end="20" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy04">The divine Ancients shared their wisdom, directing us to build great temples to house their wonders.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy04" start="21" end="26" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy05">The works of my people shone like a jewel in this New World.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy05" start="27" end="33" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy06">But madness erupted throughout the land, igniting a terrible war.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy06" start="34" end="37" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy07">Our great works were laid to waste.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy07" start="38" end="43" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy08">When the fires cooled, the Ancients had vanished.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy08" start="43" end="50" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy09">Leaving behind only ruins and a doomed race of immortal soldiers guarding empty temples.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy09" start="51" end="54" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy10">But we were determined to endure.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy10" start="56" end="62" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy11">In the absence of the Ancients, we became the masters of our own destiny.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy11" start="63" end="67" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy12">We battled the primordial beings birthed by the cataclysm.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy12" start="67" end="76" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy13">And discovered immortality became a curse. Death had not been banished, only transformed.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy13" start="78" end="81" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy14">Even the madness returned to plague us anew.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy14" start="83" end="92" speaker="Imhotep" dialogue-next="AncientsLegacy15">In the end, the Ancients' promises had been nothing but lies.</string>
	<string key="AncientsLegacy15" start="94" end="102" speaker="Imhotep">I pray they've not blinded us to the terror stirring beneath the sands...</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy01" start="1" end="7" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy02">We set out to find the Field of Reeds, the blessed home of the gods.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy02" start="7" end="15" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy03">Carrying our dying queen, our only hope lay in finding the gift of immortality.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy03" start="16" end="23" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy04">We expected to discover divine power, a paradise blessed by the Nine.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy04" start="23" end="30" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy05">But we found only ruins and devastation, the obvious result of divine wrath.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy05" start="30" end="39" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy06">Having failed our queen, her body was consigned to the desert. But we would not be defeated.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy06" start="40" end="46" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy07">Allied with the might of Rome, we would succeed where our ancestors had failed.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy07" start="48" end="54" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy08">Like mighty Perseus or Achilles, General Crassus became our greatest champion.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy08" start="54" end="60" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy09">Together, our works inspired the people and brought order to the chaos.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy09" start="61" end="67" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy10">We would honor the gods and bring about an age of enlightenment.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy10" start="67" end="72" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy11">But greed and ambition poisoned the minds of our stewards. </string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy11" start="72" end="79" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy12">The Romans coveted the power of the gods and our protectors became our oppressors. </string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy12" start="81" end="85" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy13">The gods punished them for their arrogance.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy13" start="85" end="92" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy14">The Curse of Medusa would imprison the unfaithful for centuries.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy14" start="92" end="97" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy15">The faithful would have to prove ourselves worthy before the gods would return.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy15" start="97" end="105" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy16">But the plague of evil can never be vanquished. And it corrupts everything it touches.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy16" start="105" end="112" speaker="Pontifex Charmion" dialogue-next="RomeLegacy17">Now we pray that the gods will send new champions.</string>
	<string key="RomeLegacy17" start="113" end="118" speaker="Pontifex Charmion">To vanquish the darkness and find light in the shadows of our past.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising01" start="1" end="13" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising02">This island has always guarded the promise of paradise. Humanity cast out, deemed unworthy of such blessings.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising02" start="13" end="25" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising03">But I did not come here seeking paradise. I came for answers. Redemption after a life of weakness and suffering.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising03" start="25" end="32" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising04">And I found a truth that disproved everything I had been taught.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising04" start="32" end="43" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising05">I tasted the knowledge forbidden to us at creation. And I saw the vision of humanity's true potential.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising05" start="43" end="53" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising06">I knew then, I must correct this ancient injustice, and restore the power which is rightfully ours.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising06" start="55" end="61" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising07">The heart of the mountain now beats strong with this purpose.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising07" start="61" end="67" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising08">After a century of preparation, our campaign has begun.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising08" start="67" end="73" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising09">The islands townships already fall before the might of our armies.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising09" start="73" end="77" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising10">The only thing I had not foreseen is you.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising10" start="79" end="87" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRising11">You who have stolen the gift meant for me. And now your soul will pay the price.</string>
	<string key="TempestRising11" start="87" end="100" speaker="Mysterious Voice">For I will not stop until I have seized back the destiny stolen from us. And brought true freedom to the world both old and new.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress01" start="2" end="11" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress02">Apophis is returned to the sands and Sutekh remains at rest. But the hunt has only just begun.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress02" start="13" end="22" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress03">This hunt will be my greatest yet, the wretched mass of humanity my ultimate prey.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress03" start="22" end="29" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress04">When we first appeared before them, humans were eager to learn, hungry for guidance.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress04" start="29" end="35" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress05">We approached them in forms that were familiar and showered them with blessings.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress05" start="35" end="40" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress06">But they lacked the purity shared by other creatures of these lands.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress06" start="40" end="50" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress07">I warned my brethren, these beings were not worthy of eternal life. But the gift was bestowed nonetheless.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress07" start="50" end="56" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress08">And what thanks did we receive? The fools turned against us.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress08" start="56" end="72" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress09">I knew then, annihilation of the species was our only option.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress09" start="64" end="69" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress10">But greater threats emerged, requiring our attention.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress10" start="69" end="76" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress11">Years passed, we tried to live here in peace and harmony. </string>
	<string key="WildHuntress11" start="76" end="83" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress12">But the twisted ambitions of humanity have reinvited disaster time and again.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress12" start="85" end="94" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress13">Now, however, the power of the Ennead flows through the veins of Aeternum, fuel for my grim task.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress13" start="94" end="100" speaker="Artemis" dialogue-next="WildHuntress14">I will undo the mistake my brethren made so long ago.</string>
	<string key="WildHuntress14" start="100" end="108" speaker="Artemis">I will revoke the gift, and restore your mortal birthright to a final and inevitable death.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone01" start="2" end="14" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone02">Long ago, a witch crept into the eastern fens. This was the Corpse Crone, and she cast a wicked spell.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone02" start="18" end="22" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone03">The deadly hex spread like a sickening plague.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone03" start="22" end="31" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone04">The island's immortality was twisted, made obscene. The Curse of the Lost would haunt our lands.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone04" start="31" end="40" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone05">The people sought salvation from this plague. Desperate, we believed conviction our only course.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone05" start="42" end="47" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone06">We discovered the soulless could hide amongst us.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone06" start="47" end="51" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone07">Committing them to the cold earth was the only answer.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone07" start="51" end="63" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather" dialogue-next="CorpseCrone08">Eventually, the crone's purpose became clear. Her hex would bind the restless Lost to her will.</string>
	<string key="CorpseCrone08" start="63" end="76" speaker="Tunstall Pennyfather">To this day, her foul curse lingers. Until her evil can be forever extinguished.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret01" start="1" end="8" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret02">It was the dream of Avalon that led King Artorius to these shores.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret02" start="8" end="12" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret03">And of course, the wise counsel of the enchanter, Myrddin.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret03" start="12" end="22" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret04">But the enchanter became obsessed with the island's mysteries. An insidious evil claimed his soul.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret04" start="22" end="32" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret05">The Wars of Crimson Madness raged for a century. So many banners… All fallen to the Corruption.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret05" start="32" end="38" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret06">I know not what transpired to end the conflict.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret06" start="38" end="44" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret07">We found no answers as to Myrrdin's fate, no trace of the High King.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret07" start="44" end="51" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret08">I sought new peace and purpose here in the Brightwood.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret08" start="51" end="55" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret09">But it would not last. A plague of soulless Lost emerged.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret09" start="55" end="63" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret10">Brother Umberto and I formed the Bright Vigil to fight the darkness.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret10" start="63" end="68" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret11">But he stood alone when I left in search of my lord king.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret11" start="68" end="75" speaker="Ser Galahad" dialogue-next="GalahadRegret12">I returned empty handed, to witness the results of my failure.</string>
	<string key="GalahadRegret12" start="75" end="82" speaker="Ser Galahad">The Vigil, fallen to despair, and the Brightwood, bright no more.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth01" start="1" end="8" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth02">Aeternum's secrets called to us in dreams. Promising vast, ancient knowledge.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth02" start="8" end="15" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth03">What we discovered was an entity longing for release.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth03" start="15" end="18" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth04">Myrddin believed his spell-craft would ensure protection.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth04" start="18" end="24" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth05">But this fell power claimed him for its own.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth05" start="24" end="30" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth06">As the Crimson Sorcerer, he became the Herald of Madness.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth06" start="30" end="37" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth07">When all else failed, I confronted my brother. Our magics clashed...</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth07" start="37" end="42" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth08">And then silence. I was forever changed.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth08" start="43" end="53" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth09">I knew the Corruption would return. But the power I needed came at a terrible cost.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth09" start="55" end="62" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth10">The secrets I sought continued to elude me. But I refused to relent.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth10" start="62" end="73" speaker="Morgaine" dialogue-next="MorgaineTruth11">I became the Corpse Crone, the Curse of Weaver's Fen. The target of foolish Shadow-Hunters.</string>
	<string key="MorgaineTruth11" start="73" end="84" speaker="Morgaine">I spent the centuries since alone, preparing. When the Crimson Madness returns, I shall be ready.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter01" start="2" end="5" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter02">My father called me weak.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter02" start="5" end="9" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter03">I was ten when I proved him wrong.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter03" start="14" end="24" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter04">I chose the path of the warrior. And in two years, my brothers could not match me in battle.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter04" start="25" end="31" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter05">But among spear-daughters, I forged an unbreakable bond.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter05" start="31" end="34" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter06">On Aeternum, we fought an endless onslaught of darkness.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter06" start="39" end="47" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter07">Until that day, a faceless warlock cursed us. He stole our warrior's fire. </string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter07" start="50" end="56" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter08">We tried everything to break free, even death.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter08" start="56" end="60" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter09">But nothing worked... and without our strength, what were we?</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter09" start="60" end="68" speaker="Skye" dialogue-next="SkyeLetter10">Now, our enemies pursue an even darker power in Great Cleave. They must be stopped.</string>
	<string key="SkyeLetter10" start="68" end="76" speaker="Skye">Hero of Aeternum, help me reclaim our fire, and strike our enemy asunder. </string>
	<string key="TempestRisingMB01" start="1" end="7" speaker="Mysterious Voice" dialogue-next="TempestRisingMB02">This island has always guarded the promise of paradise.</string>

	<string key="DevourerLegacy05" start="23" end="31" speaker="Speaker of the Devourer" dialogue-next="DevourerLegacy06">But our tribe, the Blood of the Sands, earned their trust, learned to speak to them.</string>
