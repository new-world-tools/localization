I’ve met souls from ancient memory, found in sagas and dusty tomes
I’ve seen ghosts and fiends and horrors,
And met knights and bold explorers
As I’ve wandered every corner of this island we call home
I’ve met kings of earthly nations,
Seen the gods of all creations,
Tasted wine at every station, from sands to misty moors,
But the partings that we weather,
And the memories we treasure
Are the souls we've Lost forever on Aeternum's forgotten shores</string>
