When you place your line correctly, you'll see a small alert telling you you've hit the hotspot.\n\nAfter enough fish are caught at a hotspot it will become depleted. You can tell a hotspot is depleted when there are no fish jumping.\n&lt;img src="lyshineui/images/tooltipimages/fishinghotspotdepleted.png" height="188"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;\nA depleted hotspot will become active again after some time has passed.\n\nAs your fishing skill improves, you will be able to find more and better hotspots.</string>
