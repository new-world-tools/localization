	<string key="ui_ckretraction_info_content2">Gather Cursed Doubloons and Resources from chests, nodes, monsters, and rival players... and escape before losing them to fellow looters. Exchange extracted Doubloons for a variety of rewards at the Well of Fortune in the settlement of Spyglass Ridge. </string>
